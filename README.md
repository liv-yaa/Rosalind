# Rosalind

A collection of my practice problems from the bioinformatics learning site Rosalind http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/
The data sets are included as text files.

Python topics include variables, arithmetic, strings and lists, conditions and loops, working with files, dictionaries
Bioinformatics topics include a simple nucleotide counter, transcribing DNA into RNA, complementing a strand of DNA, recurrence relations (fibonacci sequence), and computing GC content.
