'''
Mendel's first Law

Given: Three positive integers kk, mm, and nn, representing
a population containing k+m+nk+m+n organisms: kk individuals
are homozygous dominant for a factor, mm are heterozygous,
and nn are homozygous recessive.

Return: The probability that two randomly selected mating
organisms will produce an individual possessing a dominant
allele (and thus displaying the dominant phenotype). Assume
that any two organisms can mate.
